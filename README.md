**Student:** Prabhjot Kaur  
**Registration Number:** 12300402  
**Course:** B.Tech CSE  
**University:** DAV University, Jalandhar

## Project Overview
This project predicts the **median house value** (`median_house_value`) using multiple machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle**.  

## How to Run
1. Open `final12300402.ipynb` in Google Colab.  
2. Make sure the dataset path is correct (`data/Housing.csv`).  
3. Run all cells to see the results.

## Results
- Linear Regression R² Score: 0.63  
- Random Forest R² Score: 0.81  
- XGBoost R² Score: 0.829  

## Guidance
This project was completed under the guidance of **AppTechies Company**.
